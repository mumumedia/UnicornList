# Docs 

Welcome to Datahub Cloud documentation! 

Datahub Cloud is your stupidly simple and fast tool for turning datasets and data-driven content on GitHub into a published, shareable site.

> Note: The current version of Datahub Cloud runs only off Github.

# Quick Start

The quickest way to start publishing with Datahub Cloud is to use our template and customize it to fit your needs. You can do that in 5 simple steps:

1. Start off from our [template](https://github.com/datahubio/datahub-cloud-template) 
2. Click "Use this template" at the top right and create the repository (can be public or private - works with both)
3. Go to [the app](https://0613d040.sibforms.com/serve/MUIFAMLy5tXMDC-gFjXRxBEcvyVYV9O9KLVoKMp1n6WMXE4LBazZkkV78pTBf3FnJHdhQpJoOYL3KsAbAv9yDYJooerqar47yy2RQkuP_Vs0CEkHexRMrkWsbKtTIi_DMOa9KfzpRVFa959hSXqJByMY5Gj9OrZtEX3ZrfO5OJHh7fLxh3nYgnNIBwGTpxJ25XA_MxOKv_kHKNgM) and create a new site by selecting the repository you just created (leave the "Root Dir" field empty)
5. That's it! It is now published. Hit the green "Visit" button at the top right to see what it looks like.
6. Go to [Add visuals and data-rich components](https://datahub.io/@Daniellappv/datahub-cloud-template-2/docs/Add%20visuals%20and%20data-rich%20components) if you want to add some extra features 

# What syntax is supported?

Datahub Cloud supports CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown, but also many Obsidian-specific syntax elements, like Wiki links or footnotes[^1].
